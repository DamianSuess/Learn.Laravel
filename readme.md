# Learn Laravel 11

In this edition of the Suess Labs' Learn repository, we'll dive into the Laravel PHP framework for web applications.

Looking back, I've usually always created my own micro-frameworks with PHP to keep things lean and quick. However, maintainability and scalability can become a pinch-point throughout the product's lifecycle, so considerations should be made when starting a new product.

## Naming Conventions

There are many "rules" out there which veer off from one another, however, the following appears to be widely accepted. (_Frankly, I often use Xeno Innovations' legacy rules._)

* Models - Always singular and `PascalCase`
* Controllers - Usually singular and ending with the word, `Controller`. i.e. `PostController`
